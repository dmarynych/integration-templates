### Authorize.Net Legacy Template To Create Customer Payment Profile 

If you are using Authorize.Net, sending request with XML payload to `api.authorize.net/soap/v1/Service.asmx`(`apitest.authorize.net/soap/v1/Service.asmx` for sandbox) to create customer payment profile, you could use the template below to reveal your customer's card number and card code to it.    

Note: This template does not support the updated URL `api2.authorize.net`(`apitest2.authorize.net` for sandbox).
